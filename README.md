Welcome to "ChaseBook"! My Facebook clone created with ReactJS for the frontend running off of an API created with Express and database by MongoDB.

This was a real "bring it all together" application for me. While not my first full stack app, this was defintely the most complex along with, in my opinion, the most real world features. This project definitely helped me sharpen up my React skills and also encouraged me to continuously refactor and clean up my code.
